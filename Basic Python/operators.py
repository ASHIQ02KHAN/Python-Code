# Arithmetic operators
a, b = 10, 3
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division (float)
print(a // b) # Floor division
print(a % b)  # Modulus (remainder)
print(a ** b) # Power (10^3 = 1000)

# Comparison operators
print(a == b)  # Equal?
print(a != b)  # Not equal?
print(a > b)   # Greater than?
print(a < b)   # Less than?

# Logical operators
x, y = True, False
print(x and y)  # AND
print(x or y)   # OR
print(not x)    # NOT
